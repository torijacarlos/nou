# nou - のう - 脳

## Rationale

Lately, I've found that I struggle communicating ideas, concepts, concerns or
stuff in general.

Creating a second brain seems like a good starting point to get a more
organized view of my though process.

If somehow the internet abyss brought you here, I hope you find something
helpful, funny or interesting.

## Inbox

I clear this file and move stuff around every week, probably won't commit the
in-betweens

- [Inbox](./inbox.md)

## Resources

Mostly random stuff I've gathered around frameworks, languages and anything.
File titles hopefully are enough to find stuff.

**Personal reminder**: The purpose of this space is to:

- Have a place to structure my ideas and learn in public
- Improve how I communicate ideas/concepts with others.
