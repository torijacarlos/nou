Personal finance application

I'm mostly using it to:
- Keep track of expenses
- Establish debt payment strategies
- Detect unnecessary expenses

Todo's:

- [ ] Create module to serialize `chrono::DateTime` with `serde`
- [x] Create API to [get](https://developers.belvo.com/reference/retrieveaccounts) `Account` information attached to `link`
- [ ] Implement payment planner for debt. (Reimplement the script I had in python)
- [ ] Implement some sort of (local) caching/storage to remove unnecessary api calls to belvo
- [ ] Get Account transactions
