**On Building a second brain** 

The "cold storage" comment for projects resonated with me:
- "You don't need to make progress on everything all the time"

Practical steps
1. Decide what I want to capture
2. Setup P.A.R.A
3. Identify my (12) favourite problems
4. Automatically capture book highlights
5. Practice progressive summarization
6. Make progress on one deliverable
7. Schedule a weekly review
